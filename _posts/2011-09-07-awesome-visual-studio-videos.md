I watched an awesome Channel 9 [Visual Studio Tips And Tricks video](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV305), so I thought I'd share. Some great VS gems in there. Even a few Windows 7 ones, like using <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> to jump to the address bar in Windows Explorer, and typing "cmd" in the Windows Explorer address bar to open a command prompt at the current directory.

Also, if you're interested in what the next Visual Studio release has in store, [check out this Channel 9 video](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV326).
