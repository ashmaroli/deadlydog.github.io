I recently discovered the awesome [Format Files VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jbockle.jbockle-format-files) that allows you to format all files in your workspace.
Typically you would need to open each file in Visual Studio Code and run the `Format Document` command manually, but with this extension you can format all files with a single command.
This allows you to easily ensure all files are formatted consistently.
This is especially useful if you have a large codebase and change your code formatting settings.
e.g. changing your `.editorconfig` or `.prettierrc` settings, or modifying your VS Code code formatting settings.

The extension still needs to manually open each file in the editor and apply the formatting, so it can take a little while to run, but it sure beats doing it manually.
I hope you find this extension as helpful as I have.

Happy coding!
