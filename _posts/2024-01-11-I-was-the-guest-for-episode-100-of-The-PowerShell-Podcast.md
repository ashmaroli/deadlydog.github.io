I was recently invited to be a guest on [The PowerShell Podcast](https://powershellpodcast.podbean.com/) ([YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mL90yFExsjUS8DRkzfLUcHds7vlxqgM)) ([Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-powershell-podcast/id1616048196)).
I had a great time talking with [Andrew Pla](https://twitter.com/AndrewPlaTech).
This was my first time on a podcast, and I was very nervous.
You can tell because I was talking very fast, so hopefully I was still understandable to everyone ðŸ˜….

While I didn't realize it until a few days after recording, I was on the show's 100th episode!
[Check it out here]().
That is a huge accomplishment for the podcast, and I'm honoured to have been a part of it.

## Podcast amendments

When writing blog posts and recording videos, I have time to gather my thoughts and later update any information that I left out.
While chatting live, I don't have that luxury.
After we were done recording I was soon thinking of all the things that I could have said better, or things that I left out and should have mentioned.

If I had been able to edit the podcast, these are some things I would have mentioned:

My [PowerShell tiPS module](https://github.com/deadlydog/PowerShell.tiPS):

- Provides not only a PowerShell tip, but also:
  - Examples code of what the tip describes
  - Links to external sources for more information
  - Categorizes the tip (e.g. Performance, Security, Syntax, Terminal, Module, Community, etc.)

My favourite thing I use PowerShell for:

- Anything that requires connecting to multiple remote machines to retrieve information or run commands, such as:
  - Finding IIS website certs that are expiring soon.
  - Testing web services locally to find which servers in a pool are not responding correctly.
  - Pulling down log files from servers that are not yet using distributed logging.
  - Installing or removing software or files on multiple machines.
  - Recycling IIS app pools on multiple machines.
  - Restarting servers en masse.

## Conclusion

I try to hold the content I create to a high quality standard, and am often my own worst critic.
Writing these amendments shows that I still have some growth to do in learning how to relax and let go of things that are not perfect with the content I create.

Overall I think the podcast went well and I had a great time.
Andrew was a great host, very easy to work with, and made me feel very comfortable.
He's a true pro!
I'm looking forward to doing another show in the future.
