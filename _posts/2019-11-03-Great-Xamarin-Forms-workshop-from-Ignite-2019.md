I'm lucky enough to attend the Microsoft Ignite 2019 conference this year, and do a pre-conference workshop.
The workshop I chose to do was `Build your first iOS and Android app with C#, Xamarin, and Azure` presented by James Montemagno.

While I had to pay for the interactive hands-on experience, James was awesome enough to provide [the workshop for free on his GitHub repo](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/xamarin.forms-workshop).
So if you are new to Xamarin or haven't done it in a while, be sure to check out the repo and run through the exercises.
He provides a `Start` directory for you to start from, and a `Finish` directory containing what the finished product should look like after you've ran through each exercise part.

Before starting on the workshop, you may want to run through [this Xamarin setup](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/xamarin/hello-world-tutorial/intro) to get your machine configured to run the Android emulator so you can easily build and debug your Xamarin apps.

Happy coding!
