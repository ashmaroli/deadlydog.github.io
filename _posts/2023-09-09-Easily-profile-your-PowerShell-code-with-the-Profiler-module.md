Premature optimization may be the root of all evil, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't optimize your code where it matters.
Rather than guessing which code is slow and spending time optimizing code that doesn't need it, you should profile your code to find the true bottlenecks.
At that point you can decide if the code is slow enough to warrant optimizing.

Jakub Jare≈° has created the amazing [Profiler module GitHub repo](https://github.com/nohwnd/Profiler) for profiling PowerShell code to find which parts are the slowest.
Installing and using it is a breeze.

In this post I will walk through how I used Profiler to find a surprisingly slow part of a new PowerShell module I am developing, called [tiPS](https://github.com/deadlydog/PowerShell.tiPS).
I noticed that importing tiPS in my PowerShell profile was noticeably slowing down my PowerShell session startup time, so I decided to profile it to see if I could optimize it.

## TL;DR

If you don't want to read this entire post, just run these commands and thank me (and Jakub) later:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Profiler
$trace = Trace-Script -ScriptBlock { & 'C:\Path\To\Script.ps1' }
$trace.Top50SelfDuration | Out-GridView
```

## Installing the Profiler module

The Profiler module is available on [the PowerShell Gallery here](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Profiler/), so you can install it with:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Profiler
```

## Tracing code with the Profiler module

You profile code by tracing it, which is done with the `Trace-Script` command.
This works similarly to the `Measure-Command` cmdlet, but provides more detailed information.

To use the Profiler, simply wrap the code you want to profile in a script block and pass it to the `Trace-Script` command, and capture the output in a variable.

Trace some code inline:

```powershell
$trace = Trace-Script -ScriptBlock {
    # Code to profile goes here
}
```

Trace some code in a script file:

```powershell
$trace = Trace-Script -ScriptBlock { & 'C:\Path\To\Script.ps1' }
```

Trace some code in a script file that takes parameters:

```powershell
$trace = Trace-Script -ScriptBlock { & 'C:\Path\To\Script.ps1' -Parameter 'Value' }
```

Trace the code in your `$Profile` script that is run on every new session:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -NoExit { $trace = Trace-Script { . $Profile } }
```

Note: Depending on how you have your profile configured ([MS docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles)), you may need to reference one of the other profile file paths, such as `$Profile.CurrentUserAllHosts`.

Let's walk through tracing the code I have in my profile script to see if I can reduce my PowerShell session startup time.

You will notice some summary information is output to the console when you run the `Trace-Script` command, including the total `Duration`, which is the same info that the `Measure-Command` cmdlet would have given us.

## Viewing the profile trace information

Now that we have the trace information in the `$trace` variable, you can inspect its properties to view the trace info.

The `TotalDuration` property is the same TimeSpan that `Measure-Command` would have given us:

![Trace TotalDuration property output](/assets/Posts/2023-09-09-Easily-profile-your-PowerShell-code-with-the-Profiler-module/trace-total-duration-screenshot.png)

The real value of the Profiler is in the `Top50SelfDuration` and `Top50Duration` properties, which is a list of the top 50 slowest commands in the trace.
The 2 properties show similar information, just sorted based on `SelfDuration` or `Duration` respectively.

- `SelfDuration` is the time spent in the command itself, not including any time spent in functions that it called.
  This shows you the lines of code that are actually slow in the script.
- `Duration` is the time spent in the command, including all other functions it called.
  It shows the bigger pieces that are slow because they contain smaller slow pieces.

A good strategy is to look at the `Top50SelfDuration` first to see which specific lines of code are the slowest.
You can then look at the `Top50Duration` to see which larger parts of your script take the most time, and see if it matches your expectations.

Here is the output of the `Top50SelfDuration` property:

![Trace Top50SelfDuration property output](/assets/Posts/2023-09-09-Easily-profile-your-PowerShell-code-with-the-Profiler-module/trace-top-50-self-duration-table.png)

In this screenshot we can see that the top offender (the first row) is a line in the `tiPS` module's `Configuration.ps1` file on line `8`, which is called once and taking 693 milliseconds to execute.
`tiPS` is a module that I am currently developing and have added to my profile to automatically import it on every new session.

By default the `Top50SelfDuration` and `Top50Duration` display their output in a table view.
Unfortunately the number of columns displayed is based on your console window width.
If we make the console window wider, we can see 2 more very useful columns: `Function` and `Text`, which is the actual line of code that was executed.

![Trace Top50SelfDuration property output with wider console window](/assets/Posts/2023-09-09-Easily-profile-your-PowerShell-code-with-the-Profiler-module/trace-top-50-self-duration-table-wider-width.png)

Even with the wider console window, much of the text is still cut off.
To see the full text we have a couple options.
We can pipe the output to `Format-List`:

```powershell
$trace.Top50SelfDuration | Format-List
```

![Trace Top50SelfDuration property output in Format-List](/assets/Posts/2023-09-09-Easily-profile-your-PowerShell-code-with-the-Profiler-module/trace-top-50-self-duration-list.png)

This is good for seeing details about each individual entry, but not great for viewing the entire list.

My preferred approach is to pipe the results to `Out-GridView`:

```powershell
$trace.Top50SelfDuration | Out-GridView
```

![Trace Top50SelfDuration property output in Out-GridView](/assets/Posts/2023-09-09-Easily-profile-your-PowerShell-code-with-the-Profiler-module/trace-top-50-self-duration-grid-view.png)

This allows me to see all of the columns, reorder and hide columns I don't care about, as well as sort and filter the results.

Now that we have the `Text` column, we can see that the top offender is a call to `Add-Type -Language CSharp`.
Since `tiPS` is my module, I know that line is being used to compile and import some inline C# code.
The 3rd row shows the same operation for importing a different C# file.
Since it is a single line of code calling a library that I do not own, there's not much I can do to optimize it outside of considering a different strategy for importing C# code or not using C# at all, which may be something to consider.

Moving on, the 2nd row shows a call to `Set-PoshPrompt` taking 624 milliseconds.
I use this third party module to customize my prompt with oh-my-posh.
In fact, looking at the `Module` column, you can see many of the slowest commands are coming from 3 third party modules that I import in my profile script: `oh-my-posh`, `posh-git`, and `Terminal-Icons`.
Since it is third party code there's not much I can do outside of not loading those modules automatically at startup, which I may decide to do if they impact my startup time enough.

With that in mind, let's focus on the code that I can optimize.
The 6th row shows another top offending line in the `tiPS` module.

![Trace Top50SelfDuration property output in Out-GridView with 6th row highlighted](/assets/Posts/2023-09-09-Easily-profile-your-PowerShell-code-with-the-Profiler-module/trace-tips-dot-source-offending-line.png)

Notice that this line has a total `Duration` of 1054 milliseconds, due to it being called 15 times.
On initial inspection, it appears that this line of code is slowing the module load time even more than our initial top offender (we'll come back to this).
This is made more apparent when we sort by `Duration`:

![Trace Top50Duration property output in Out-GridView sorted by Duration](/assets/Posts/2023-09-09-Easily-profile-your-PowerShell-code-with-the-Profiler-module/trace-tips-dot-source-offending-line-sorted-by-duration.png)

We can ignore the top row as it is dot-sourcing the file that contains all of my custom profile code, which is why the `Percent` shows as `99.79`.
I keep my custom profile code in a separate file and dot-source it into the official $Profile so that it can be shared between PowerShell 5 and Pwsh 7, as well as automatically backed up on OneDrive.

Looking in my `tiPS.psm1` file on line `25`, I see that it is looping over all of the files in the module directory and dot-sourcing them:

```powershell
$functionFilePathsToImport | ForEach-Object {
    . $_
}
```

This dot-sourcing strategy allows for better code organization by keeping module functions in separate files, rather than having one giant .psm1 file with all of the module code.
A quick Google search shows me that others have come across [this dot-sourcing](https://becomelotr.wordpress.com/2017/02/13/expensive-dot-sourcing/) [performance issue](https://superuser.com/questions/1170619/is-dot-sourcing-slower-than-just-reading-file-content) [as well](https://www.codykonior.com/2019/04/18/expensive-dot-sourcing-in-powershell-modules-revisited/).
Naively we may think that this is giving additional evidence that the dot-sourcing may be the main issue.

Earlier we saw that the `Add-Type` command was taking 693ms in Configuration.ps1, and 210ms in PowerShellTip.ps1.
That is 903ms total.
I did a `Trace-Script -ScriptBlock { Import-Module -Name tiPS }` to see how long it takes to just import the tiPS module, and found the entire import takes 1180ms.
Configuration.ps1 and PowerShellTip.ps1 are 2 of the 15 files that get dot-sourced in the module, and they alone take 903ms of the 1180ms to load the module.

This highlights the difference between `SelfDuration` and `Duration`.
The `Duration` of the dot-sourcing was including the time spent in all of the operations of the dot-sourced files, such as the `Add-Type`operations.
In the screenshot we can see that the dot-sourcing `Duration` is 1054ms, and the `SelfDuration` is 129ms.
So the act of dot-sourcing the 15 files, regardless of what the files contain, is taking 129ms.
We know it takes 903ms to execute the two `Add-Type` commands in the dot-sourced files, so that means the time it takes to execute the operations in the other 13 files being dot-sourced is 1054ms - 903ms = 151ms.

So dot-sourcing 15 files takes 129ms, which isn't too bad.
I imagine (but did not test) the time will increase linearly with the number of files dot-sourced, so if you have a large project that dot-sources hundreds of files, you could be looking at several seconds of time spent just dot-sourcing the files; not executing the code in the files.
While dot-sourcing is a bit slow, it is not the main offender in my scenario.
The main performance issue is the `Add-Type` commands to compile and import the C# code.
I never anticipated that one command would have such a drastic impact on the module load time!

Since the tiPS module is intended to be loaded on every new PowerShell session, I need to find a way to speed up the module load time.
This might mean not using C# code, or taking some other approach; I'm not sure yet.
The main point is that I now know where the bottleneck is and can focus my efforts on optimizing that code.

## Conclusion

By using the Profiler module for less than 2 minutes I was able to identify a major performance issue that I would not have otherwise known about.
Without it, I likely would have spent time optimizing other parts of my code that would not have as much impact.

Profiling your code is as easy as:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Profiler
```

then:

```powershell
$trace = Trace-Script -ScriptBlock { & 'C:\Path\To\Script.ps1' }
$trace.Top50SelfDuration | Out-GridView
```

Profiler has more features that I did not cover in this post, such as using Flags to easily change the functionality of the code in the script block and compare them (e.g. to compare two different implementations), and functions for running the script block multiple times and taking the average performance metrics.
Be sure to check out [the Profiler git repo](https://github.com/nohwnd/Profiler) for more info.

I hope you've found this post helpful.

Happy profiling!
