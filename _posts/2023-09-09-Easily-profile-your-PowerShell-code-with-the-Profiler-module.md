Premature optimization may be the root of all evil, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't optimize your code where it matters.
Rather than guessing which code is slow and spending time optimizing code that doesn't need it, you should profile your code to find the true bottlenecks.
At that point you can decide if the code is slow enough to warrant optimizing.

Jakub Jare≈° has created the amazing [Profiler module GitHub repo](https://github.com/nohwnd/Profiler) for profiling PowerShell code to find which parts are the slowest.
Installing and using it is a breeze.

In this post I will walk through how I used Profiler to find a surprisingly slow part of a new PowerShell module I am developing, called [tiPS](https://github.com/deadlydog/PowerShell.tiPS).
I noticed that importing tiPS in my PowerShell profile was noticeably slowing down my PowerShell session startup time, so I decided to profile it to see if I could optimize it.

## Installing the Profiler module

The Profiler module is available on [the PowerShell Gallery here](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Profiler/), so you can install it with:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Profiler
```

## Tracing code with the Profiler module

You profile code by tracing it, which is done with the `Trace-Script` command.
This works similarly to the `Measure-Command` cmdlet, but provides more detailed information.

To use the Profiler, simply wrap the code you want to profile in a script block and pass it to the `Trace-Script` command, and capture the output in a variable.

Trace some code inline:

```powershell
$trace = Trace-Script -ScriptBlock {
    # Code to profile goes here
}
```

Trace some code in a script file:

```powershell
$trace = Trace-Script -ScriptBlock { & 'C:\Path\To\Script.ps1' }
```

Trace some code in a script file that takes parameters:

```powershell
$trace = Trace-Script -ScriptBlock { & 'C:\Path\To\Script.ps1' -Parameter 'Value' }
```

Trace the code in your `$Profile` script that is run on every new session:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -NoExit { $trace = Trace-Script { . $Profile } }
```

Note: Depending on how you have your profile configured ([MS docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles)), you may need to reference one of the other profile file paths, such as `$Profile.CurrentUserAllHosts`.

Let's walk through tracing the code I have in my profile script to see if I can reduce my PowerShell session startup time.

You will notice some summary information is output to the console when you run the `Trace-Script` command, including the total `Duration`, which is the same info that the `Measure-Command` cmdlet would have given us.

## Viewing the profile trace information

Now that we have the trace information in the `$trace` variable, you can inspect its properties to view the trace info.

The `TotalDuration` property is the same TimeSpan that `Measure-Command` would have given us:

![Trace TotalDuration property output](/assets/Posts/2023-09-09-Easily-profile-your-PowerShell-code-with-the-Profiler-module/trace-total-duration-screenshot.png)

The real value of the Profiler is in the `Top50SelfDuration` and `Top50Duration` properties, which is a list of the top 50 slowest commands in the trace.
The 2 properties show similar information, just sorted based on `SelfDuration` or `Duration` respectively.

- `SelfDuration` is the time spent in the command itself, not including any time spent in functions that it called.
- `Duration` is the time spent in the command, including all other functions it called.

Here is the output of the `Top50SelfDuration` property:

![Trace Top50SelfDuration property output](/assets/Posts/2023-09-09-Easily-profile-your-PowerShell-code-with-the-Profiler-module/trace-top-50-self-duration-table.png)

In this screenshot we can see that the top offender (the first row) is a line in the `tiPS` module's `Configuration.ps1` file on line `8`, which is called once and taking 693 milliseconds to execute.
`tiPS` is a module that I am currently developing and have added to my profile to automatically import it on every new session.

By default the `Top50SelfDuration` and `Top50Duration` display their output in a table view.
Unfortunately the number of columns displayed is based on your console window width.
If we make the console window wider, we can see 2 more very useful columns: `Function` and `Text`, which is the actual line of code that was executed.

Even with the wider console window, much of the text is still cut off.
To see the full text we have a couple options.
We can pipe the output to `Format-List`:

```powershell
$trace.Top50SelfDuration | Format-List
```

![Trace Top50SelfDuration property output in Format-List](/assets/Posts/2023-09-09-Easily-profile-your-PowerShell-code-with-the-Profiler-module/trace-top-50-self-duration-list.png)

This is good for seeing details about each individual entry, but not great for viewing the entire list.

My preferred approach is to pipe the results to `Out-GridView`:

```powershell
$trace.Top50SelfDuration | Out-GridView
```

![Trace Top50SelfDuration property output in Out-GridView](/assets/Posts/2023-09-09-Easily-profile-your-PowerShell-code-with-the-Profiler-module/trace-top-50-self-duration-grid-view.png)

This allows me to see all of the columns, reorder and hide columns I don't care about, as well as sort and filter the results.

Now that we have the `Text` column, we can see that the top offender is a call to `Add-Type -Language CSharp`.
Since `tiPS` is my module, I know that line is being used to import some inline C# code.
The 3rd row shows the same operation for importing a different C# file.
There's not much I can do to optimize that outside of considering a different strategy for importing C# code or not using C# at all, which may be something to consider.

Moving on, the 2nd row shows a call to `Set-PoshPrompt` taking 624 milliseconds.
I use this third party module to customize my prompt with oh-my-posh.
In fact, looking at the `Module` column, you can see many of the slowest commands are coming from 3 third party modules that I import in my profile script: `oh-my-posh`, `posh-git`, and `Terminal-Icons`.
Since it is third party code there's not much I can do outside of not loading those modules automatically at startup, which I may decide to do if they impact my startup time enough.

With that in mind, let's focus on the code that I can optimize.
The 6th row shows another top offending line in the `tiPS` module.

![Trace Top50SelfDuration property output in Out-GridView with 6th row highlighted](/assets/Posts/2023-09-09-Easily-profile-your-PowerShell-code-with-the-Profiler-module/trace-tips-dot-source-offending-line.png)

In fact, notice that this line has a total `Duration` over 1 second, due to it being called 15 times.
This means that this line of code is slowing the module load time even more than our initial top offender.
This is made more apparent when we sort by `Duration`:

![Trace Top50Duration property output in Out-GridView sorted by Duration](/assets/Posts/2023-09-09-Easily-profile-your-PowerShell-code-with-the-Profiler-module/trace-tips-dot-source-offending-line-sorted-by-duration.png)

We can ignore the top row as it is dot-sourcing the file that contains all of my custom profile code, which is why the `Percent` shows as `99.79`.
I keep my custom profile code in a separate file and dot-source it into the official $Profile so that it can be shared between PowerShell 5 and Pwsh 7, as well as automatically backed up on OneDrive.

Looking in my `tiPS.psm1` file on line `25`, I see that it is looping over all of the files in the module directory and dot-sourcing them:

```powershell
$functionFilePathsToImport | ForEach-Object {
    . $_
}
```

This allows for better code organization by keeping module functions in separate files, rather than having one giant .psm1 file with all of the module code.
I never anticipated that it would have such a drastic impact on the module load time!
A quick Google search shows me that others have come across [this dot-sourcing performance issue](https://superuser.com/questions/1170619/is-dot-sourcing-slower-than-just-reading-file-content) as well.

Since the tiPS module is intended to be loaded on every new PowerShell session, I need to find a way to speed up the module load time.
This may mean creating a build step that combines all of the files into the .psm1 file, rather than doing it at runtime via dot-sourcing.
Or I may take some other approach; I'm not sure yet.
The main point is that I now know where the bottleneck is and can focus my efforts on optimizing that code.

## Conclusion

By using the Profiler module for less than 2 minutes I was able to identify a major performance issue that I would not have otherwise known about.
Without it, I likely would have spent time optimizing other parts of my code that would not have as much impact.

Profiling your code is as easy as:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Profiler
```

then:

```powershell
$trace = Trace-Script -ScriptBlock { & 'C:\Path\To\Script.ps1' }
$trace.Top50SelfDuration | Out-GridView
```

I hope you've found this post helpful.

Happy profiling!
