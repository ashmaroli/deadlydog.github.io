message: "Uhhh... Not to be rude.  This post seems to be mostly about adding keyboard shortcuts for Windows Terminal, but there are existing keyboard shortcuts in both Windows 10 and Windows 11.  [ (Windows + X), i ] will open a user level Windows Terminal.  [ (Windows + X), a ] opens the Administrator level Windows Terminal.\r\n\r\nThere used to be an option in Windows Settings which would allow you to change it between cmd.exe and Powershell.  That was in Windows 10 and now that I am in Windows 11, even opening cmd.exe opens it in Windows Terminal.\r\n\r\nOnce that keyboard shortcut works, you can set up the profiles for powershell, command prompt, or best of all WSL.  So if you are doing linux development, you can have it open the terminal for which you are developing.  Even if you are not using a local development platform and need SSH, you can set that up to.  Simply duplicate your powershell profile, then set the command line for the profile as follows:\r\n\r\n%SystemRoot%\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -Command \"ssh root@10.0.0.16\"\r\n\r\nYou can either set this as the default start up option, or access it via the down arrow in the taskbar title.  I've got one setup for my firewall, SAN, and Proxmox Server.  You could take this even further and set up Windows terminal to remember what tabs were open on last launch.  So it can launch Powershell, Command Prompt, WSL, and SSH.  All of them at the same time to all the hosts you need automatically as long as you don't close the tabs.  For this example, I would say to set your \"New Instance Behavior\" to attach to recently used window, so there are no accidents."
