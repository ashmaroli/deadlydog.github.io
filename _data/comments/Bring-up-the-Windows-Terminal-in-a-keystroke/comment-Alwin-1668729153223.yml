message: "Thank you very much for this script (I'm using method 4), it works fantastically and is exactly what I needed. As you (and others here in the comment section) I used ConEmu and for me the toggle option was the primary reason of using it. ConEmu however often Ã­gnores my AutoHotKey scripts which is beyond annoying. I also very much appreciate that you added the feature to simply switch to the Terminal window if it's already open.  It is really the absolute worst if you want to toggle towards your terminal and you see it minimize. Having it come to focus is crucial for the experience that you're in control and everything is working fast and smoothly.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who wants so supercharge their experience and have the terminal appear instantly when toggled (not have its appearance animated): you can turn of these animations in Windows by going to Settings > Ease of access > Display (or simply search for animations in Settings) and turn off 'Show animations in Windows'. Of course, this will turn them off for the whole system, i.e. all windows will not show any animations when minimized / maximized etc. This is a potential drawback, but in my experience everything will feel more snappy / responsive this way. And actually, there always seem to be one millisecond of an intermediate frame when doing this, so you can see it expand and don't have to wonder where it went (what happens if there is literally no animation). The animation is simply 'blazingly fast' as they say. So, play around with it and do whatever you like.\r\n\r\nSo again, thank you very much for sharing your script. I'm a very happy user of it now."
