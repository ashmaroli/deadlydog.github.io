message: "Thank you so much for this post! \r\n\r\nI really liked the look of Windows Terminal but couldn't switch from ConEmu because I depend too much on the ability to focus on it with a keyboard shortcut (essential for a tool which uses a keyboard to control it).\r\n\r\nI was about ready to give up and then found this post. I'm looking forward to getting to know Windows Terminal a little better now.\r\n\r\nI was going to use the win+n approach, but I thought this is a good chance to try and get AHK baked into my workflow."
