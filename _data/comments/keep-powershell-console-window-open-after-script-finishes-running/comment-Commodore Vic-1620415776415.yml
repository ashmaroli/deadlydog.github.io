  i had the same question as Colin, i have some users that need to ping a
  handful of computers that are not admins,  was able to make a script and even
  add the Read-Host -Prompt "Press Enter to exit" and works great for me but
  would like to have a shortcut for the select users to simply click on. having
  a few issues with this final step
