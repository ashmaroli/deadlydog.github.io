  Your post, Daniel, is great, thank you for a pretty well starting point. I
  have spent some hours with Pester, this is great tool, bravos for
  contributors, but it is not intended to work with binary cmdlets. And because
  we like xUnit, and this is our weapon of choice... One tip for an update is
  that [.NET Core has the template for Powershell
  module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/writing-portable-modules?view=powershell-7#creating-a-new-module).
  Thanks a lot!
