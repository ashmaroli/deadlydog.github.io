  @shalini you likely have your $PfxFilePath parameter or the Working Folder set
  incorrectly, as it's saying it can't find the file .pfx file at the path
  you're providing. If you're providing a relative path for the $PfxFilePath
  parameter it will look for it in the Working Folder; otherwise you can try
  providing the absolute file path to the .pfx file if you have it.
