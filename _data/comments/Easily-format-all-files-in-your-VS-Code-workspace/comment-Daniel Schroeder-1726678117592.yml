  Hey Colin, Visual Studio comes with support for a bunch of different languages
  out of the box, but VS Code does not. You will typically need to install an
  extension to get intellisense, syntax highlighting, etc. for most languages
  (e.g. C#, Go, Python, PHP, PowerShell). I believe VS Code only supports
  JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS out of the box. All this Format Files VS
  Code extension does is run the `Format Files` command on every file in the
  workspace; just as if you ran the command manually yourself from the command
  palette. If you haven't installed an extension or configured a code formatter
  in VS Code for the given file type, it will not know how to properly format
  the file. So the short answer to your question is, yes, you will typically
  need to install an extension that supports the language of the file type you
  want to format.
