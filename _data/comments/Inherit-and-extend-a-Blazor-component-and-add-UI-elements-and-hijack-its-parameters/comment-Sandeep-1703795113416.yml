  Hey, this looks great thanks for the article. I have common base class with
  all application-level stylings and logs which I need to inject in every
  component. But I am unable to do that because after I inherited a Radzen
  component. I can't inherit the other. Is there way that I can inherit my base
  component class and Radzen class.
