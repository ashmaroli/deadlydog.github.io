  This does not work at all in Windows 10. I followed the recipe to a T. When
  logging in, up comes a window asking what programme I would want the file
  opened in (weird, since .ahk files are associated with AHK). I choose AHK. It
  then gives the error message "Script file not found:
  C:\Users\<username>\OneDrive\AHK" (the folder where I have stored the script)
