  Hey @Jitters, I suspect it's a configuration issue with your machine or your
  scheduled task. Either way, I'd recommend following this approach instead
  (https://blog.danskingdom.com/get-autohotkey-to-interact-with-admin-windows-without-running-ahk-script-as-admin/),
  as it will always open AHK as admin, not just when it's launched by the
  Windows scheduled task.
