message: "Thank you, @deadlydog, for this blog post. I've been struggling with getting a build/release of a ClickOnce app from Azure DevOps Services, for an awfully long time. This blog post looks like it will address issues I've struggled with.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'd like to ask. Some of the images you've got in this blog post, are too fuzzy that I cannot read them. For example, the Copy Files image in Step 3, I cannot read what is meant to be read (not what you've intentionally blurred out). Is there a way those could be either larger or made clickable to that I can see a larger version of them, please?"
