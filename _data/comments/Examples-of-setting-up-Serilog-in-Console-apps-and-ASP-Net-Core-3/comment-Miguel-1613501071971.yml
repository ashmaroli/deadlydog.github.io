  Thanks for sharing this great material Daniel. I spent several hours hoping
  around to find out which were the minimum packages and configuration necessary
  to use Serilog from a Windows Service, until I found your blog. The examples
  are very concise and clear, plus the fact that you prepared three different
  projects let me understood better by means of contrasting them.
