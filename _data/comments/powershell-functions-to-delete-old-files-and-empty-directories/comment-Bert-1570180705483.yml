message: "Hi @Deadlydog,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thanks for the script.\r\n\r\nI seem to run in a problem with empty directories. I want all files older than 7 days to be deleted and all empty folders but NOT the TEMP folder itself.\r\n\r\nI use this line but the directories, that are older than 7 days, are not deleted. \r\nRemove-FilesCreatedBeforeDate -Path \"c:\\temp\" -DateTime ((Get-Date).AddDays(-7)) -DeletePathIfEmpty\r\n\r\nThanks"
