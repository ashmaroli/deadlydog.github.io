message: "Hey guys, \r\nWith this fix, my admin mode apps now respect the hotkeys. One strange issue : After a hotstring/key runs, I need to hit the Win key to \"end\" it. For example, I have a hotkey (Win + 2) to activate all Chrome windows to bring them into the foreground. When I press Win+2, the Chrome windows get activated, but if I type any key after that, weird windows pop up. I have to hit the Windows key to disable this every time."
