message: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI also needed to change the version build number, and ended up using the counter. But for me it works also for the name: definition in the yaml file. I have defined two variables in the GUI for the pipeline (Pipeline Variables), like:\r\n\r\nbuildMajorMin = 1.5\r\nbuildStartCounter = 22\r\n\r\nIn the top of the yaml file I have:\r\n\r\nvariables:\r\n  buildRev: $[counter(variables['buildMajorMin'], variables['buildStartCounter'])]\r\n\r\nname: $(buildMajorMin).$(buildRev)"
