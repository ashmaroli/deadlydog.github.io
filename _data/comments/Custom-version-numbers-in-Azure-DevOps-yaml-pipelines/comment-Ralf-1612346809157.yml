message: "Hi Daniel,\r\n\r\nnice work, well done. I think there is a bug in the last script, it hasn't worked for me until I have initialized the variable prereleaseVersionNumber with the stabelVersionNumber instead of versionNumber whitch was still set to 'Set dynamically below in task' in line 17:\r\n\r\n    [string] $prereleaseVersionNumber = \"$(stableVersionNumber)-ci$dateTime+$(Build.SourceVersion)\"\r\n\r\nafter that it worked verry well. \r\n\r\nThanks for sharing!!!"
