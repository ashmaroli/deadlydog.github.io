In this post we'll cover:

- What is the Windows clipboard.
- The basics of using the Windows clipboard for copying and pasting ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsSSVS7gY0)).
- Look at new clipboard features introduced in Windows 10 ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob2FHVPyXhc)).
- Be more productive by using some free 3rd party tools that take the clipboard to the next level ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBvKvJfWw2c)).

I've provided links to videos that cover these topics as well if you prefer to learn that way.

## What is the clipboard

The Windows clipboard is simply a place that you can `copy` information to, and `paste` to get it out again.

You've likely used the clipboard before, but may not have known what it was called.
Any time you copy or cut, you are placing information from an application on the clipboard, and when you paste you're copying that information from the clipboard back out into an application.

You can copy pretty much any type of information into the clipboard, including text, images, and files/directories.

## Windows clipboard basics

The basic clipboard operations are:

- Copy: Copy information from an application onto the clipboard.
- Cut: Copy information from an application onto the clipboard, and also remove that information from the application.
- Paste: Copy information from the clipboard into an application.

You can typically find these operations in an application's context menu by selecting some text/images/files and right-clicking with the mouse.

A much quicker method is to use the keyboard shortcuts.

- Copy: `Ctrl` + `C`
- Cut: `Ctrl` + `X`
- Paste: `Ctrl` + `V`

Sometimes an application may not have these operations in their mouse context menu, or may not even provide a context menu at all, but the keyboard shortcuts work in most cases.

## Windows 10 clipboard enhancements

Before Windows 10, there was no way of seeing what was in the clipboard, if anything, besides to try pasting it.
Also, the clipboard could only hold the last information that was copied; i.e. one item.

Windows 10 introduced a new feature called the Windows Clipboard History.
This feature includes the following benefits:

- Can hold the last 25 items copied. Older items roll off the clipboard and cannot be accessed any more.
- Allows you to visualize the clipboard and pick which item you want to paste.
- Allows you to "Pin" items so they don't roll off the clipboard.
- Allows you to share your clipboard between other devices.

You can access the clipboard settings by hitting the Windows key and searching for `Clipboard settings`.

As the shown in the screenshot, all you need to do to access Clipboard History feature is hit `Windows Key` + `V`.
If the Clipboard History feature is not enabled, the window will prompt you to turn it on.

Once enabled, just start copying things.
If you want to paste the last thing you copied, then use `Ctrl` + `V` as usual to paste.
If you want to access something you copied earlier though, use `Windows Key` + `V` and the Clipboard History window will appear and show you the last items you copied.
From there, choose the item that you want and it will be pasted into your application.

Nice.

And, it's built right into Windows 10, so there's no need to download or install anything extra; it's just there.

### What's lacking in the Windows 10 Clipboard History

While it's definitely an improvement, the Clipboard History feature is far from perfect.
Here's some downsides:

- Only holds the last 25 copied items, which isn't enough in my opinion.
- All 25 items are cleared every time you restart your computer.
- Cannot search in the Clipboard History.
- Images don't always show up; seems to depend how they are copied or which application they were copied from.
- The Clipboard History window cannot be moved or resized.

Hopefully these limitations will be addressed in later Windows updates, but at the moment they exist.

Happy copy-pasting :)
