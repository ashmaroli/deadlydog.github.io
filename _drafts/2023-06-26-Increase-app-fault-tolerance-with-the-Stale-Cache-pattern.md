Caching is used to improve the performance of an application.
When applied properly, caches can help increase an application's fault tolerance, helping to prevent outages, reduce latency, and improve the user experience.
In this post I introduce the `Stale Cache` pattern and show how to use it to greatly increase the fault tolerance of your applications.

I have not seen this pattern used in any caching libraries, and do not know if it has an official name, so I am calling it the `Stale Cache` pattern.
If you know of it by a different name, please let me know in the comments below.
This pattern has helped prevent production outages in several systems I've worked on, and I hope it can help you too.

## TL;DR

The `Stale Cache` pattern retains stale cache items and returns them if needed until they can be replaced with fresh ones.
It is not a replacement for other time-based caching strategies, but rather an enhancement that can be applied to them to help make your applications and systems more fault tolerant.

## What is a cache?

[Wikipedia defines a cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) as,

> A hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster.

Basically, a cache is a place to store data that is used frequently so that it can be accessed faster than if it were retrieved (or calculated) from the original source every time, improving the speed of the application.

Caching is a huge topic with many considerations, such as:

- Where in your application stack should you do the caching? In the client application, the web server, the database, or a separate component such as a Redis server or CDN.
- What type of cache to use? In-memory, disk, or distributed.
- What caching strategy to use? Cache-aside, read-through, write-through, write-around, write-back, refresh-ahead, etc.
- How do you handle cache invalidation? Expiration (absolute time, sliding window, etc.), eviction (least recently used, least frequently used, random, etc.), or something else.

Depending on your application, you may implement several different caches at different layers, each with different strategies and configurations.

There are tons of great articles on caching, like [this](https://dev.to/kalkwst/database-caching-strategies-16in) and [this](https://medium.com/geekculture/overview-of-caching-distributed-cache-caching-patterns-techniques-6130a116820) and [this](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/6-caching-strategies-for-system-design-interviews-8cf22193b360) and [this](https://www.neovolve.com/2008/10/08/cache-expiration-policies/) and [this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-caching-patterns-microservices-architecture-saeed-anabtawi/), so I won't go into any more detail here.

## What is fault tolerance?

[Wikipedia defines Fault tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance) as,

> The ability of a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components.

In this article, I'm focusing on having your application remain operational when an external service that it retrieves data from is unavailable, such as a database or web service.

## What is the Stale Cache pattern?

### Story time

Let's illustrate the pattern through a short story.

Imagine you want to make a sandwich.
You go to your kitchen and get some bread.
You notice that while the bread is not moldy, it has passed its best-before date and is a bit stale.
Fresh bread always makes a sandwich taste way better, so you toss the stale bread in the garbage and walk to the bakery to get some fresh bread.
When you arrive at the bakery you find they are closed because a water pipe burst and they will not be open until tomorrow.
There are no other bakeries nearby, so you go back home.
Now you are home, still hungry, and unable to make a sandwich because you have no bread.

You might say, well just pull the stale bread out of the garbage and make a sandwich with that.
Even if you are the type to pull food out of the garbage ([like George Costanza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t36jwyVncmQ) ðŸ˜‚), in this hypothetical scenario let's say that your roommate already _collected the garbage_ and took it out (see what I did there ðŸ˜›), so the bread really is gone.

With no bread for a sandwich and your stomach growling, you reflect on what you could have done to avoid this unhappy situation.
The answer is simple; you should not have thrown out the stale bread until you had fresh bread to replace it.
This is the Stale Cache pattern.

### How is this different from traditional time-based caching?

In the cache implementations I've seen, the cache item is given a single expiration time.
When the expiration time is reached, the item is removed from the cache.
The next time something tries to access the item, it is not found in the cache and the item must be retrieved from the source, such as a database or another web service.
If the source is unavailable, then the item cannot be retrieved and the application fails or has to perform some additional compensating action.

By holding on to the stale cache item until a fresh item is available, the cache can return the stale item to the caller and the application can continue to function even when the source is unavailable, making the application more fault tolerant.

> Retaining stale cache items until they can be replaced with fresh ones makes your application more fault tolerant.

### Additional details

You likely want to remove stale items from the cache eventually though, as using data that is too old may cause other problems in your application.
Just like how you wouldn't want to make a sandwich with bread that was molding, you may not want to use data that is too old.
We call the date that the cached item is no longer safe to use the Expiry date.

There are 3 states for a cache item in the Stale Cache pattern:

- __Fresh__: The item has not yet reached its Stale (or best-before) date.
  The item is not stale yet and can be used without any additional actions.
- __Stale__: The item has passed its Stale date, but not its Expiry date.
  The item is stale, but can still be used safely.
  A fresh item should be requested from the source and the cache updated with the fresh item.
- __Expired__: The item has passed both its Stale and Expiry date.
  The item is expired and cannot be used safely.
  The expired item should be removed from the cache and discarded.
  A fresh item should be requested from the source and the cache updated with the fresh item.

As with any cache, you still need to be mindful of how long in the future you set the Stale and Expiry dates.
Different pieces of data likely have different freshness requirements.


--- TODO: Add a picture of the Stale Cache pattern here ---


In our story, you may have been too hungry to wait for fresh bread.
An alternative would have been to make your sandwich using the stale bread, and ask your roommate to go to the bakery for fresh bread while you eat.
When your roommate returns with the fresh bread, you can throw out the stale bread and use the fresh bread for your next sandwich.

This is another way to implement the Stale Cache pattern, where you return the stale cache item right away and request a fresh item in the background, allowing the cache to be updated with the fresh item asynchronously so it can be used for future cache requests.

## When to use the Stale caching pattern

### - Enhance existing caching strategies

The Stale Cache pattern is not meant to replace any caching strategies, but rather is meant to be used in conjunction with them, when applicable.
For example, if you are using the cache-aside strategy, when you discover that the item returned from the cache is stale, you could request a fresh item from the source and then update the cache with the fresh item.
If the source is unavailable and you cannot obtain a fresh item, you can continue working with the stale item, making your application more resilient.

### - Enhance existing fault tolerance strategies

Similarly, the Stale Cache pattern is not meant to replace other fault tolerance strategies, like retries or circuit breakers.
They can be used together to make your application even more fault tolerant.
For example, you may return a stale cache item while also retrying failed requests to the source in the background to retrieve a fresh item.

### - When cache item eviction is based on age

The Stale Cache pattern is by nature centered around time expiration, so it is not applicable when using non-time based cache invalidation strategies, such as least-recently-used or least-frequently-used eviction algorithms.

### - Read-only operations

The Stale Cache pattern is only applicable to read operations, not write operations.

### - Can improve speed at the expense accuracy

The Stale Cache pattern is a good fit for applications that value speed over accuracy.
Depending on the implementation, it can allow applications to return stale cached data right away and then fetch updated data in the background.

### - Data that is not extremely time sensitive

The Stale Cache pattern provides fault tolerance when the external source is unavailable for a period of time.
The greater the expiry time of the data, the more fault tolerance the Stale Cache pattern can provide.

If the data is considered expired after a very short amount of time though, such as a few seconds, then the Stale Cache pattern is not likely to provide much benefit since chances are the external source will be unavailable for more than a few seconds.

The Stale Cache pattern is highly suited for data that is not extremely time sensitive, and that does not change frequently, as typically data that does not change often can have a longer expiry time.
Examples of this type of data include:

- Auth tokens (typically have an expiry of 1 hour or more)
- Product names, descriptions, and images (typically change infrequently, so could mark as stale after 1 hour, but not expire for 48 hours)
- Product prices (if the business values making a sale over selling the item at a slightly older price)
- Countries, provinces / states, cities, postal / zip codes, etc. (typically change infrequently)
- Lists of clients or users (typically change infrequently)

## Example implementation of the Stale Cache pattern

Below is a basic example of incorporating the Stale Cache pattern into an in-process cache that uses the cache-aside strategy in C#.
In-process cache-aside caches are very popular for desktop applications, and web services that do not need to scale.
I build upon the .NET MemoryCache class in this example.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Internal;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace Caching;

public enum StaleMemoryCacheResult
{
  ValueFound,
  StaleValueFound,
  ValueNotFound
}

public class StaleMemoryCache
{
  private readonly ILogger<StaleMemoryCache> _logger;
  private readonly IMemoryCache _memoryCache;

  public StaleMemoryCache(ILogger<StaleMemoryCache> logger, IMemoryCache memoryCache)
  {
    _logger = logger ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(logger));
    _memoryCache = memoryCache ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(memoryCache));
  }

  public StaleMemoryCacheResult TryGetValue<T>(object key, out T? value)
  {
    bool hasValue = _memoryCache.TryGetValue(key, out CacheItem<T>? item);
    if (!hasValue || item == null)
    {
      _logger.LogDebug("Cache miss for key '{key}'. Item was either never added to cache or it expired.", key);
      value = default;
      return StaleMemoryCacheResult.ValueNotFound;
    }

    bool isStale = item.StaleDate < DateTimeOffset.UtcNow;
    if (isStale)
    {
      _logger.LogDebug("Cache hit for key '{key}', but item is stale.", key);
      value = item.Value;
      return StaleMemoryCacheResult.StaleValueFound;
    }

    _logger.LogDebug("Cache hit for key '{key}'.", key);
    value = item.Value;
    return StaleMemoryCacheResult.ValueFound;
  }

  public void Set<T>(object key, T value, TimeSpan timeUntilItemIsStale, TimeSpan timeUntilItemExpires)
  {
    var cacheItem = new CacheItem<T>
    {
      Value = value,
      StaleDate = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.Add(timeUntilItemIsStale)
    };
    var expiryDate = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.Add(timeUntilItemExpires);
    _memoryCache.Set(key, cacheItem, expiryDate);
  }

  private class CacheItem<T>
  {
    public T Value { get; set; } = default!;
    public DateTimeOffset StaleDate { get; set; } = DateTimeOffset.MinValue;
  }
}
```

The main differences between this an your typical cache are:

- To to set an item in the cache you must provide _two_ times; the time before the item is considered stale, and the time before the item expires (is removed from the cache).
  Current cache libraries typically only allow you to specify the expiry time.
- The cache returns a `StaleMemoryCacheResult` enum instead of a boolean.
  This allows the caller to know if the item was found in the cache, if the item was found but is stale, or if the item was not found in the cache.
  There are other ways to implement this, such as having explicit functions for checking if an item is stale or not instead of returning an enum.
  This choice was just a personal preference.

If you are not a fan of the variable names `timeUntilItemIsStale` and `timeUntilItemExpires`, alternatives could be `minTtl` and `maxTtl` respectively (TTL = Time To Live).

An example of using the above class with the cache-aside strategy might look like this:

```csharp
private readonly TimeSpan TimeBeforeFetchingFreshAuthToken = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
private readonly TimeSpan MaxTimeToUseStaleAuthTokenFor = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(60);

public async Task<string> GetAuthToken()
{
  string? authToken;
  var cacheResult = _staleMemoryCache.TryGetValue(AuthTokenCacheKey, out authToken);

  // If we have a fresh auth token in the cache, return it.
  if (cacheResult == StaleMemoryCacheResult.ValueFound)
  {
    return authToken;
  }

  // Otherwise, we either don't have an auth token or it is stale, so try to get a fresh one.
  // (An alternative approach could be to return the stale auth token right away and try to get a fresh one in the background.)
  var authItem = await GetFreshAuthTokenFromExternalService();

  // If we successfully retrieved a fresh auth token, add it to the cache and return it.
  bool authRetrievedSuccessfully = (authItem is not null);
  if (authRetrievedSuccessfully)
  {
    authToken = authItem.Token;
    _staleMemoryCache.Set(AuthTokenCacheKey, authToken, TimeBeforeFetchingFreshAuthToken, MaxTimeToUseStaleAuthTokenFor);
    return authToken;
  }

  // Otherwise we could not get a fresh auth token, so if we have a stale auth token in the cache, return it.
  bool weHaveACachedAuthToken = (cacheResult == StaleMemoryCacheResult.StaleValueFound);
  if (weHaveACachedAuthToken)
  {
    _logger.LogWarning("Could not retrieve a fresh auth token, so using a stale cached one instead.");
    return authToken;
  }

  // Otherwise we could not get a fresh auth token and we do not have one in the cache, so throw an exception.
  throw new Exception("Could not retrieve an auth token and there are no cached ones to use.");
}
```

Check out [this gist](https://gist.github.com/deadlydog/3169ff35abc95c4607acf5730a12932b) for more complete example code, including unit tests.

This is only one possible implementation of the Stale Cache pattern.
I chose to keep it simple for the sake of this example, but there are many other things you could do to improve it.
You may want to have it fetch fresh items in the background and return stale items immediately.
You may want to store a delegate with the cache item that can be used to have it refresh itself, and move the logic of when to retrieve a fresh item into the cache class.

While this example shows how to use the Stale Cache pattern with an in-process cache-aside strategy, it can be similarly incorporated into distributed caches and other cache strategies.

## Other considerations

Report telemetry on how often stale items are used.

Can block while retrieving fresh items, or retrieve them in the background.

[RFC 5861](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5861) introduced the `stale-while-revalidate` and `stale-if-error` HTTP Cache Control extensions, which are implementations of Stale Cache pattern.
Even though the spec was proposed in 2010, many web browsers and web services still do not support it.
Some of the products that do support it though give good guidance on how and when to use it, such as the [Fastly docs](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/concepts/stale/) and [Amazon CloudFront docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html), which you may find applicable to your own applications when implementing the Stale Cache pattern.


I'll start by saying that this is a pattern I thought up and have used many times in the past.
I think it is relatively straight forward and a kind of obvious solution, but I have not seen it documented anywhere, either by this name or any other.
If you know of this pattern by a different name, please let me know in the comments.


> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

The Stale Cache pattern helps make time-based cache invalidation more forgiving by allowing you to pick a time range instead of a point in time.

https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html


## Conclusion

The Stale Cache pattern is a simple pattern that can be used to make time-based cache invalidation more forgiving by allowing you to pick a time range instead of a point in time.
It can make your apps and services more resilient by reducing the amount of time that they depend on external services to be up for.
This is especially important in microservice architectures where the number of external service dependencies are often very high.

There is nothing overly complicated or complex with this pattern, making it fairly easy to understand and implement.
I hope this pattern eventually becomes standard functionality in all caching libraries that offer time-based expiration.

I hope you find it useful in your applications.
Happy coding!
