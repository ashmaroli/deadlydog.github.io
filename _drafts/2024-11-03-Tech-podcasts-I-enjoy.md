I started listening to podcasts in the summer of 2023, and have found them to be a great way to keep up-to-date with the latest trends in the tech industry.
They're also a great way to get perspectives on the softer side of the tech industry, such as career advice and hearing other software developers stories.

Here are some of the podcasts I enjoy, and why I like them:

- [Azure DevOps podcast](https://azuredevopspodcast.clear-measure.com): This podcast is hosted by Jeffrey Palermo, and is a great way to keep up-to-date with the latest .NET and Azure features and technology.
  He interviews a wide range of guests, such as Microsoft employees and MVPs, .NET-related authors, and other software developers in the industry, some of which have several decades of experience.
- [The PowerShell podcast](https://powershellpodcast.podbean.com/): This podcast is hosted by Andrew Pla, and features guests from the PowerShell community.
  This podcast is a great way to stay up-to-date with what is happening in the PowerShell world, hear from others who use PowerShell regularly, and learn about new modules and tools that can help make IT pros and developers more productive.
- [The Hanselminutes podcast](https://hanselminutes.com): This podcast is hosted by Scott Hanselman, and features guests from the tech industry.
