My name is Daniel Schroeder, my online handle is usually `deadlydog`, and I live in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. I completed my Masters degree in Computer Science at the University of Regina in 2009, and am currently working at [iQmetrix](http://www.iqmetrix.com/). I have a passion for programming and have created some video games and websites; I especially enjoy creating tools for other developers, and tools for increasing productivity. Automate EVERYTHING!
