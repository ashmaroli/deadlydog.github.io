title: "💬 Feedback I've received from colleagues"
---

In 2021 I started keeping track of feedback that I received from my peers at work.
Unfortunately I wasn't very diligent about keeping track of them years ago, so many are lost, but I was able to track down some from years past.
This page is a compilation of that feedback.

## What my colleagues have to say about me

2024-06-06 - From Maryam Bagherzadeh in Slack:

> Thanks Dan!
> I'm grateful for our 1-1s, your insights and perspectives!
> You are a great mentor Dan, I'd recommend you to keep that going, share your knowledge, perspectives and greatness with other devs/mentees too :slightly_smiling_face:

2024-01-15 - Anonymous feedback from 4 individuals on a lunch and learn presentation I gave on Dev Containers and GitHub Codespaces:

Individual 1:

> I really enjoyed how Dan made it so people could follow along in Visual Studio Code and try setting up their own Dev Containers, it really helped to reinforce the concepts that were being presented.
> Dan's presentation skills are always top notch!

Individual 2:

> I really enjoyed the hands on/demo format.
> I'm sure Dan could've presented some slides and called it a day but being able to actually try something is extremely helpful for my knowledge retention.

Individual 3:

> Dan is great at explaining things!
> I thought he chose a really nice level of detail, where I felt like I saw and understood the actual code being used to run and use dev containers, but also wasn't bogged down with unnecessary details.

Individual 4:

> Great balance in supporting explanations with slides and practical demonstrations.

2023-05-03 - PDLG (Product Development Leadership Group) and Development Leads in Slack:

> Dan is an amazing gift to us

2022-11-08 - Steven Swab in Slack:

> I wanted to give @deadlydog-DanSchroeder a shout out for exemplifying a number of our core values.
> He's a `High-horsepower` guy who `Delivers Results` and demonstrates excellent `Servant Leadership`.
> My team was decommissioning an old service, and asked for some help with access to machines I can't access.
> Dan didn't just offer help, but went through and taught me how to remove the service and associated jobs, tasks, etc.
> Despite circumstances not being ideal for its decommissioning, Dan put in extra effort to ensure that the customer wouldn't be impacted and that if they were we could reverse the changes quickly.
> Thank you Dan - The `High-horsepower`, `Servant Leader`, who `Delivers Results`.
> You make all of us at iQ better.

Reply from Maryam Bagherzadeh:

> @deadlydog-DanSchroeder is great! Knowledgeable, helpful plus humble!

2021 Employee of the Year

> In preparing this description of our Employee of the Year winner I asked a few folks for input.
> In each response the central theme was "helping".
> Helping is certainly what I've seen our winner doing very often.
> Never too busy to help others.
> Always looking for ways to give back and to **elevate the people around them**.
> Elevating the people around them is such central factor in everything they do.
> They don't just provide an answer or perform a task, but provide an explanation, or make a video that many people can watch and learn how to solve a similar problem.
> They plan their personal work around how they can use it to enable others to learn and grow too.
>
> Helping people pervades our winners life.
> They maintain a personal blog full of helpful information for anyone on the internet to use.
> The first help I ever received from them was via their public blog, before I even knew we both worked for the same company.
> I've even heard a story from a colleague of how helpful our winner was back in University before either of them even started to work at IQ.
>
> Our winner has been described as selfless, which is plainly true.
> And as a swiss army knife, because they have a solution for all your problems.
> My personal favorite is that they are like Emmett the "Everything is Awesome guy" from the lego movie, happy and always, always a team player.
> As soon as I heard it, it immediately felt right.
>
> Our winner this year has been with IQ for many years.
> For those who were involved in the selection process a very common question was "Why has it taken so long for them to win?".
> The truth is they deserved to win many times.
> But our winner is always helping in the background and never grabbing the spotlight for themselves.
> Clearly this award is loooong overdue!
>
> I want to offer an enormous congratulations and, a bright bright spotlight, to our 2021 Employee of the Year….
> Dan Schroeder.

2021 Q2 SLICCE Nomination from Vincent Langevin

> Dan is showing true community by helping out the Windows Desktop Tech Stack Team right now!

Dexter (circa 2019):

> Dan is always helpful and always provides a ton of insight into what he sees, and where he sees it, so that not only am I getting the help I need, but also learning where to look and what to look for when situations arise.
> I wish everyone provided as much insight and context into the help they are giving, because that in turn allows us to learn and not just be told that it's fixed, thus I can also share that knowledge.
>
> I've had many times in the past where I've required assistance and Dan was the one to help me get to the bottom of the problem I/the client am/are seeing, and every time I come out of the experience feeling like I have gained knowledge which I can use in resolving other issues because I now have a better understanding of how things work, and what they affect.
>
> Dan is a great resource and I appreciate the assistance I get from him in every interaction.

> Dan is the man.
> He's always available to lend a hand, and always jumping in when there is an issue.

>
> I would say his patience is one of his best qualities.
> Even if your not quite sure how to ask for what your trying to do, Dan will work with you to determine exactly what it is you need and help you get there even if it takes a full afternoon.

---

Kelly Jardine (circa 2018):

> WHEN WAS THIS PERSON AT THEIR BEST?
>
> I believe Dan is at his best all of the time.
> For example, the things he accomplishes when he has time to put his head down and solve insane database messes is insane to me.
> But then, you ask him to get on a phone with a Client to explain this insanely complicated task he is taking on and he kills it!
> Dan is a rockstar internally and externally.
> His patience for me and my demanding questions is greatly appreciated.
>
> WHAT DO YOU WISH THIS PERSON KNEW THAT MIGHT CHANGE THE WAY THEY WORK?

> He is thoughtful in everything he does and says.

---

Julian Rendell (circa 2012):

>Dan always shows great character, and sense of community- from being SLICCE nominator of the year in 2011, to his dedication to making sure the right things end up at the right time in the right place, working, ah, just right.
> He treats all teams and projects, even those in other offices with the same care and attention to detail.
>
> He combines speed and agility to ensure deliveries to customers happen on time (even outside of normal working hours), noticing patterns and pitfalls to lead to innovations that save time and frustration.
> His willingness to listen to both sides of an argument and synthesis even better solutions is remarkable.
> A case in point: he made the "production RQ4 installer" available to the Sprint Enterprise team in Vancouver, making it much easier for our developers to work with RQ4.
> This action has saved the enterprise team a very large number of hours, frustration and headaches.
>
> Dan also takes great care to respect his environment, both colleagues and use of company equipment.
>
> Finally, given all the traits and characteristics exhibited at work, I'm sure Dan very carefully balances his lifestyle to ensure his roles as parent and partner are never neglected.

> I feel like Dan is someone that is a quiet unsung hero.
> Being the Nominator of the Year last year showed that he always takes the time to recognize his peers when he himself deserves recognition as well.

>
> Speaking of character, Dan exudes this every time someone asks him for help.

> He’s always putting in extra time to make sure that his own tasks get done, and he’s always taking on extra tasks that the team needs!
> With all the work that we have been putting in for our enterprise clients, Dan has consistently stayed late to get work done on time, and make sure that all teams can continue working without interruption – this affects all RQ teams, including QA and our release team.
> A lot of people have sacrificed because of the deadlines we have, but Dan has been one who has continually stepped up to deliver.

For a long while circa 2011 I was responsible for merging our various code branches during a code freeze to create new versions of our flagship product.
That's when the team made this gem 😊
