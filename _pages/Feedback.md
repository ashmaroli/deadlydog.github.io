title: "💬 Feedback I've received from colleagues"
---

A while back I started keeping track of feedback that I received from my peers at work.
Unfortunately I wasn't very diligent about keeping track of them years ago, so many are lost, but I was able to track down some from years past.
This page is a compilation of that feedback.

## What my colleagues have to say about me

2021 Employee of the Year

> In preparing this description of our Employee of the Year winner I asked a few folks for input.
> In each response the central theme was "helping".
> Helping is certainly what I've seen our winner doing very often.
> Never too busy to help others.
> Always looking for ways to give back and to **elevate the people around them**.
> Elevating the people around them is such central factor in everything they do.
> They don't just provide an answer or perform a task, but provide an explanation, or make a video that many people can watch and learn how to solve a similar problem.
> They plan their personal work around how they can use it to enable others to learn and grow too.
>
> Helping people pervades our winners life.
> They maintain a personal blog full of helpful information for anyone on the internet to use.
> The first help I ever received from them was via their public blog, before I even knew we both worked for the same company.
> I've even heard a story from a colleague of how helpful our winner was back in University before either of them even started to work at IQ.
>
> Our winner has been described as selfless, which is plainly true.
> And as a swiss army knife, because they have a solution for all your problems.
> My personal favorite is that they are like Emmett the "Everything is Awesome guy" from the lego movie, happy and always, always a team player.
> As soon as I heard it, it immediately felt right.
>
> Our winner this year has been with IQ for many years.
> For those who were involved in the selection process a very common question was "Why has it taken so long for them to win?".
> The truth is they deserved to win many times.
> But our winner is always helping in the background and never grabbing the spotlight for themselves.
> Clearly this award is loooong overdue!
>
> I want to offer an enormous congratulations and, a bright bright spotlight, to our 2021 Employee of the Year….
> Dan Schroeder.

2021 Q4 SLICCE Nomination from Shahram Koukia

> I firmly believe that Dan is iQmetrix MVP, for many reasons.
> I have had the privilege of working with Dan for almost two years now, and anyone who works with him knows he's the best, personally and professionally.
> He’s very dependable, he’s Culturally fit, he has all the leadership qualities, the most hardworking person with the most amazing can-do attitude you meet in your life.
> His positivity is contagious, he is all about learning and teaching, he makes people around him comfortable, especially when they’re vulnerable and most of all, he gets shit done the best way possible.
> He’s the kind of employee that every employer dreams of and he has decided to stay with iQmetrix.
> Don’t get me started on his technical expertise and abilities, he is simply amazing! If it wasn’t for Dan, we could not have done the Toronto and Philly migration, he pushed through, put his sweat and blood into the work, he was also the one pulling everyone along.
> He’s not human, he can’t be.

2021 Q4 SLICCE Nomination from Cathy McKay

> Dan is always professional when dealing with others, you can see the respect he has earned within the company in the way the conversations he's involved in evolve.

---

2021 Q2 SLICCE Nomination from Vincent Langevin

> Dan is showing true community by helping out the Windows Desktop Tech Stack Team right now!
> During the Philadelphia Migration Windows Desktop Tech Stack had a TON of services to update and deploy to the new datacenter, and to help ensure that we meet the deadlines that we were given, Dan has graciously given some of his time to help the team out and get a few of our services updated and deployed!
> Without Dan's tireless effort we definitely couldn't have done it!”

Dexter (circa 2019):

> Dan is always helpful and always provides a ton of insight into what he sees, and where he sees it, so that not only am I getting the help I need, but also learning where to look and what to look for when situations arise.
> I wish everyone provided as much insight and context into the help they are giving, because that in turn allows us to learn and not just be told that it's fixed, thus I can also share that knowledge.
>
> I've had many times in the past where I've required assistance and Dan was the one to help me get to the bottom of the problem I/the client am/are seeing, and every time I come out of the experience feeling like I have gained knowledge which I can use in resolving other issues because I now have a better understanding of how things work, and what they affect.
>
> Dan is a great resource and I appreciate the assistance I get from him in every interaction.

Tyler Foraie (circa 2018):

> Dan is the man.
> He's always available to lend a hand, and always jumping in when there is an issue.
> I feel like he does a good job communicating with his team, keeping them up to date on projects that will be coming down the pipeline, or just listening to any comments or concerns they might have with any of the current work.
>
> I would say his patience is one of his best qualities.
> Even if your not quite sure how to ask for what your trying to do, Dan will work with you to determine exactly what it is you need and help you get there even if it takes a full afternoon.
>
> I believe Dan is an asset to this company in both his knowledge of how things work and how he treats his coworkers with respect.

Kelly Jardine (circa 2018):

> WHEN WAS THIS PERSON AT THEIR BEST?
>
> I believe Dan is at his best all of the time.
> For example, the things he accomplishes when he has time to put his head down and solve insane database messes is insane to me.
> But then, you ask him to get on a phone with a Client to explain this insanely complicated task he is taking on and he kills it!
> Dan is a rockstar internally and externally.
> His patience for me and my demanding questions is greatly appreciated.
>
> WHAT DO YOU WISH THIS PERSON KNEW THAT MIGHT CHANGE THE WAY THEY WORK?
>
> Honestly.. I can't think of anything.
> The way he takes his time to figure out what is best for the company and clients should not be changed.
> He is thoughtful in everything he does and says.

Julian Rendell (circa 2012):

>Dan always shows great character, and sense of community- from being SLICCE nominator of the year in 2011, to his dedication to making sure the right things end up at the right time in the right place, working, ah, just right.
> He treats all teams and projects, even those in other offices with the same care and attention to detail.
>
> He combines speed and agility to ensure deliveries to customers happen on time (even outside of normal working hours), noticing patterns and pitfalls to lead to innovations that save time and frustration.
> His willingness to listen to both sides of an argument and synthesis even better solutions is remarkable.
> A case in point: he made the "production RQ4 installer" available to the Sprint Enterprise team in Vancouver, making it much easier for our developers to work with RQ4.
> This action has saved the enterprise team a very large number of hours, frustration and headaches.
>
> Dan also takes great care to respect his environment, both colleagues and use of company equipment.
>
> Finally, given all the traits and characteristics exhibited at work, I'm sure Dan very carefully balances his lifestyle to ensure his roles as parent and partner are never neglected.

Kathy Chenglath (circa 2012):

> I feel like Dan is someone that is a quiet unsung hero.
> Being the Nominator of the Year last year showed that he always takes the time to recognize his peers when he himself deserves recognition as well.
>
> Dan stepped up to the plate this year to create a Dev Ops group.
> The purpose of the group is to create new ways to make things easier for other developers.
> Not only does this show innovation but it shows great character to want to help his peers so much in their day to day.
>
> Speaking of character, Dan exudes this every time someone asks him for help.
> I can think of countless times where anyone on the team has asked a question that I don't know the answer to and the first person I can think of to pose the question to is Dan.
> And for the most part he always knows the answer!
> He also always shows speed and agility every time as he usually has a response so quickly within the day.
> If he doesn't know the answer, he usually knows who to point you to in order to find that answer.
>
> All in all Dan has proven that he's an important asset to the team that we can all count on and demonstrates the company values effortlessly :)
