# List of things to still do to the blog

- Fix up all build errors and warnings.
  - `Invalid theme folder: _sass` build warning is a bug in Jekyll: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7630
- Add Google Analytics integration.
  - Added, but still need to test and verify it, but can't do that until actually on the blog.danskingdom.com URL.
